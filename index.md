# Monday April 12th, 5-7:30pm - First ever Delano Disc Golf volunteer night & league planning
# Meet near basket 7 / tee 8. Arriving late is fine. Park in the gravel lot behind the hockey rink

## We're close to having 18 holes and could use some help getting things finished. Bring some work gloves. Additional equipment to bring if you have it:

* shovel
* post hole digger
* digging bar
* wheel barrow
* trash grabber
* 5 gallon bucket
* garden rake (the kind with stiff metal tines)

## League planning ideas

* Entry fee $1/night goes to improvements at the course
* Open night: all are welcome
  * Monday evenings
  * Two divisions if enough players
    * Recreational division - just for fun with optional ace pot
    * Competitive division - occasional mini tournaments, richer ace pot, tags if there's interest
* Women's night
  * Day of the week TBD by participants
  * Structure TBD by participants
